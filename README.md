A macOS menu bar app that tracks clipboard history so you can go back in time and find anything you copied.

## Why CopyBear ‚ÅâÔ∏è
I spent some time writing a really good description for a merge request at work but needed to make a few little changes before creating the MR so I decided against creating a draft MR (rookie mistake). Instead, I copied the description and made a mental note to avoid copying any other thing until after I create the MR.

Well, the mental note sure didn't stick. I CMD+V'd another stuff and lost my really good MR description. I then tried to see if macOS had a clipboard history so I can retrieve my really good description. Answer is no. I got pissed, rewrote the description and made another mental note to build something that maintains clipboard history. That mental note stuck, hence **CopyBear**.
